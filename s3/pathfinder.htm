  <p>Pathfinder is a little utility for multiplayer games based on the Q3 engine, that queries all internet game servers for game status such as connected players, current map and so on. You can simply search for friends, which are currently connected to
    any holomatch server. My intention was to write a very simple and intuitive tool without the extreme overhead of gamespy or similar progs. Compared with Gamespy there are some other advantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>uses much less memory, if you join a game, it will close itself and therefore use no memory at all while gaming</li>
    <li>the server ping is the time from your computer to the selected game server, not the time from the gamespy master to the game server</li>
    <li>colored names are displayed correctly (control keys will be stripped)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;Pathfinder is free software, so you can use and distribute it without any fee :-).</p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>Extract pathfinder.exe from pathfinder.zip to wherever you want and place a link on your desktop (right drag&amp;drop). Pathfinder needs the MFC runtime&nbsp; which must be installed on your system. Most probably some other application has already installed
    these dlls (mfc42.dll, msvcrt.dll, msvcp60.dll). If not, you will get some error messages complaining that some functions or dlls are missing. You can get the newest MFC dlls from <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com">windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a>.(vcredist.exe)
    or many other places on the web.</p>
  <h2>Using Pathfinder</h2>
  <p>Connect to the internet and start Pathfinder. Using Pathfinder is simple: Click the '<b><font color="#ffffcc">Query Servers</font></b>' button to query all running holomatch servers. The tables are now filled with the gathered information. The tabs
    '
    <b><font color="#ffffcc">Player</font> <font color="#ffffcc">list</font></b>' and '<b><font color="#ffffcc">Server list</font></b>' are switching between two different views. The first shows a flat list of all players currently logged in. The second
    shows a list of all running servers. If you select one of the server entries, the dependent table to the right shows all players logged on to the selected server.&nbsp; In the '<b><font color="#ffffcc">Speed</font></b>' box you can select your internet
    connection speed. It determines the maximum number of parallel queries. The '<b><font color="#ffffcc">Include empty servers</font></b>' checkbox does exactly what it says: it queries every server even if the master server says that there are no connected
    players.&nbsp;Check '<b><font color="#ffffcc">Exclude bots</font></b>' to filter all players with zero ping (most probably bots).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Beginning with version 1.8 there is a new button '<b><font color="#ffffcc">Query Favorites</font></b>', which will query only your favorite servers, circumventing the master server. To add a server to your favorites list, simply right click on a server
    in the server view and select 'Add to favorites'. You can view and edit your favorites by clicking the '...' button right to the 'Query Favorites' button. By clicking into the cells of the table, you can edit the server name, ip and password.</p>
  <p>No matter which view is active, you can search for a friend by entering his name in the field above the '<b><font color="#ffffcc">Search</font></b>' button. If the player is found,&nbsp; the corresponding table entries will be marked. The search is
    case insensitive. Every entered name will be stored to the registry, so the next time you can select it by entering the first few chars or opening the list. You can delete a name from the list by selecting it and pressing the '
    <font color="#ffffcc"><b>Del</b></font>' button. If the first char is a '*', every player whose name contains the search string is found. So if you search for *xyz, the following players would be found: [<b><font color="#008000">XYZ</font></b>] Bugatto, <b><font color="#008000">xyz</font></b>_mistyred
    or Borg<b><font color="#008000">xyz</font></b>ar. Typing xyz would only find <b><font color="#008000">xyz</font></b>_mistyred</p>
  <p>If you have found a friend or server, simply click the '<b><font color="#ffffcc">Join</font></b>' button. The game will start and directly connect to the selected server. The first time you will be asked for the location of the Start Trek Voyager Elite
    Force Holomatch Executable (stvoyHM.exe).&nbsp;If the server needs a password, you can enter one in the pwd edit box.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can customize the tables (sorting, width, column order) by clicking in the header section, drag&amp;drop headers, or using the right mouse button. All changes are saved in the registry (HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Pathfinder), so the next time you
    start Pathfinder it will look like the time you last closed it. When a table is sorted by one single column, you can search this column by simply typing the search string.</p>
  <p>Because Elite Force clients and servers have to be the same version, you can select the version of your installation. Currently 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 are supported. 1.0 is the original game and 1.1 is the first patch released.&nbsp;The Expansion Pack works
    with 1.2. Sometimes the master server (master.stef1.ravensoft.com) does not respond. Don't worry, wait a few seconds and try again. If you still get an error, you will be probably behind a firewall, which blocks the chosen UDP port. If not, Pathfinder
    will query the last known servers. (The last known servers are saved to vxx.dat every time the master responds. You can edit the file manually, if you like.)</p>

Because it uses some non free libraries, you will probably not be able to compile it, though. But it is sufficient to understand the essential parts.</p>

  <h2>Expression of thanks</h2>
  <p>Many thanks to Steve Jankowski (author of <a href="http://www.activesw.com/people/steve/qstat.html">qstat</a>) and Kris Sum (<a href="http://coldstorage.gamecop.com/frames.htm">kquery</a>). Although I couldn't figure out how to use their programs for
    STVOYHM ;-) their source and documentation helped me very much. Especially useful was the list of <a href="http://0x00.org/random/Halflife/QueryingGameServers.txt">game query codes</a> from Kris Sum. I wish to thank all EF players who supplied me
    with feedback and good ideas.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Thank you very much! </p>
